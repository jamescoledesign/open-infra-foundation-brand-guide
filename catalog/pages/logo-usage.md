#### **Clear Space**  

There should always be a margin of clear space surrounding the logos to ensure legibility. Depending on the logo, clear space will be 25% to 100% of the height of the logo. 

- **Icon:**  No less than 50% of the overall height 
- **Primary Logo:** No less than 50% of the overall height
- **Stacked Logo:**  No less than 25% of the overall height 
- **Secondary Logo:**  No less than 50% of the overall height 
- **Full Horizontal Logo:** No less than 100% of the overall height

#### **Logo Don'ts**  

Do not modify the logos in any way—only official, approved logos should be used. If a new version is needed, it must be reviewed by the team before being used. These rules apply to all foundation brands and member logos.
