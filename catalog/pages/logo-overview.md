#### **Concept** 

Borrowed from the visual of civic infrastructure, such as road and transit signage, our logo features a stylized arrow as the primary icon. This arrow is inspired by the multi-colored lines found on transit maps and is composed of 4 lines to represent the [Four Opens](https://openinfra.dev/four-opens/). The theme alludes to the global nature of our community, our softwareâ€™s use in literal civic infrastructure, and the idea that the foundation exists to help projects along their journey.

#### **Construction** 

The Open Infrastructure Foundation Logo is composed of an icon and logotype. While the icon can be used on its own without the logotype, e.g., social media avatars, the logotype should not be used on its own without the icon.
