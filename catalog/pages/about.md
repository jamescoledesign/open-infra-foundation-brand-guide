The Open Infrastructure Foundation promotes the global development, distribution and adoption of open infrastructure with more than 105,000 community members from 187 countries around the world. The foundation was founded in September 2012 to provide an independent home for the OpenStack cloud operating system, which has since become one of the largest and most diverse open source projects in history.

In December 2017, the foundation began incubating new Strategic Focus Areas, starting with Container Infrastructure, CI/CD and Edge Computing. The Strategic Focus Areas include include new pilot projects and communities, the first of which are Kata Containers, Zuul and the Edge Computing Group.
