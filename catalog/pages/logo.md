#### **Concept** 

Borrowed from the visual language of civic infrastructure, such as road and transit signage, our logo features a stylized arrow as the primary icon. This arrow is inspired by the multi-colored lines found on transit maps and is composed of 4 lines to represent the [Four Opens](https://openinfra.dev/four-opens/). The theme alludes to the global nature of our community, our software’s use in literal civic infrastructure, and the idea that the foundation exists to help projects along their journey.

#### **Construction** 

The Open Infrastructure Foundation Logo is composed of an icon and logotype. While the icon can be used on its own without the logotype, e.g., social media avatars, the logotype should not be used on its own without the icon.

#### **Versions**  

There are a number of logo configurations available. The primary logo displays “Open Infrastructure” on one line with “Foundation” underneath and left-aligned. Alternate versions can be used if the primary logo is not a good fit for the space. There is a stacked version, a secondary logo with the name on three lines, and a fully horizontal logo. Each is available with black or white text.  

###### **PRIMARY:**

#### **Clear Space**  

There should always be a margin of clear space surrounding the logos to ensure legibility. Depending on the logo, clear space will be 25% to 100% of the height of the logo. 

- **Icon:**  No less than 50% of the overall height 
- **Primary Logo:** No less than 50% of the overall height
- **Stacked Logo:**  No less than 25% of the overall height 
- **Full Horizontal Logo:** No less than 100% of the overall height
